# MAYOR – Experimental Game Engine (Work in Progress)

MAYOR is an experimental game engine exploring simulation-driven systems,
agent behavior, and data-oriented design. This repository represents an
active work in progress and is not yet production-ready.

## Project Status
🚧 **Early / Experimental**
- Core architecture is under active development
- APIs are unstable and subject to change
- Performance, security, and UX are not finalized

## Current Capabilities
- [Brief, factual bullet points of what actually works]
- Example: Core loop scaffolding
- Example: Prototype entity/component system
- Example: Early data ingestion or simulation logic

## What Is Not Done Yet
- Rendering pipeline (incomplete)
- Tooling / editor support
- Documentation beyond high-level notes
- Testing and benchmarking

## Why This Repo Exists
This repository exists to:
- Track development publicly
- Share architectural experiments
- Serve as a portfolio and learning artifact

## Not Ready For
- Production use
- Commercial deployment
- External contributions (for now)
